## Overview

This system manages the full student admission lifecycle across multiple colleges:

- **College Configuration** — Colleges, departments, programs, subjects
- **Admission Cycles** — Configurable yearly intake cycles per program
- **Application Processing** — Students apply with merit scores
- **Selection Engine** — Pluggable strategies (merit-based, extensible)
- **Enrollment & Academics** — Subject assignment upon enrollment

All data is persisted in flat CSV files — **no database, no external libraries**.

## Architecture

```
CLI Controllers  →  Service Layer  →  Repository Layer  →  CSV Files
                                            ↑
                                      Model (POJOs)
```

- **Model**: Pure domain entities (College, Student, Application, etc.)
- **Repository**: CSV-backed CRUD via interfaces (one file per entity)
- **Service**: Business logic, validation, orchestration
- **Controller**: CLI menus, user I/O, delegates to services

See [docs/system-design.md](docs/system-design.md) for full architectural details.

## Documentation

| Document | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [System Design](docs/system-design.md) | Architecture, SOLID mapping, data flow |
| [Data Model](docs/data-model.md) | Entity definitions, relationships, ID conventions |
| [CLI Flow](docs/cli-flow.md) | Menu structures, state transitions |
| [CSV Design](docs/csv-design.md) | File schemas, ID generation, update strategies, constraints |

## Architecture — Interfaces Layer

All business logic and data access are programmed against **interfaces**, enabling
storage-agnostic design and strict layer separation:

### Repository Interfaces (11)

| Interface | Domain Methods | Purpose |
| --------- | -------------- | ------- |
| `Repository<T>` | save, findById, findAll, updateAll | Base CRUD contract |
| `CollegeRepository` | — | College persistence |
| `DepartmentRepository` | findByCollege | College→Dept hierarchy |
| `ProgramRepository` | findByDepartment | Dept→Program hierarchy |
| `AdmissionCycleRepository` | findActiveByProgram | Active cycle queries |
| `StudentRepository` | findByEmail | Auth & uniqueness |
| `AdminRepository` | findByEmail | Auth lookup |
| `ApplicationRepository` | findByStudentAndCycle, findByCycle, findByStatus | Application workflows |
| `EnrollmentRepository` | findByStudentAndCycle, findByProgram | Enrollment constraints |
| `SubjectRepository` | findByProgram, findByProgramAndSemester | Subject assignment |
| `StudentSubjectRepository` | findByStudent | Student's subjects |

### Service Interfaces (7)

| Interface | Key Methods | Responsibility |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| `AuthService` | registerStudent, loginStudent, loginAdmin | Authentication |
| `ApplicationService` | apply, getApplicationsByStudent/Cycle | Application workflow |
| `SelectionService` | runSelection(cycleId, strategy) | Delegated selection |
| `EnrollmentService` | enroll | Enrollment + subject assignment |
| `AcademicService` | getSubjectsByStudent | Academic queries |
| `AdminService` | addCollege/Dept/Program/Subject, createCycle | Configuration |
| `AnalyticsService` | getApplicationCount, getEnrollmentStats | Reporting |

### Strategy Interface (1)

| Interface | Method | Purpose |
| --------- | ------ | ------- |
| `SelectionStrategy` | select(applications, seatCount) | Pluggable selection algorithm |

## Persistence Layer (CSV)

All data is stored in **flat CSV files** under the `/data` directory:

- **10 CSV files** — one per entity (colleges, departments, programs, etc.)
- **Auto-created** — files are created with headers on first run
- **Prefixed IDs** — auto-generated as `PREFIX-XXXX` (e.g., `STU-0001`)
- **Append for inserts** — O(1) writes for new records
- **Full rewrite for updates** — necessary because CSV rows are variable-length
- **Referential integrity** — enforced at the service layer, not file level
- **No joins** — relationships resolved programmatically via foreign key columns

See [docs/csv-design.md](docs/csv-design.md) for complete schema definitions.

## Design Principles

- **SOLID** — Every class has one responsibility; abstractions over concretions
- **No external dependencies** — Pure Java, CSV persistence
- **Fully configurable** — No hardcoded colleges or programs
- **Pluggable selection** — Strategy pattern for admission selection
- **Clean status model** — `ApplicationStatus` is {APPLIED, SELECTED, REJECTED}; enrollment is a separate entity
